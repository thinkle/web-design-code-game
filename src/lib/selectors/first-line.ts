# Style the first line of text with \`::first-line\`

The \`::first-line\` pseudo-element lets you style **only the first line** of a block of text.  
The exact amount of text affected depends on the containerâ€™s width and wrapping.

\`\`\`css
p::first-line {
  font-weight: bold;
  color: red;
}
\`\`\`

This would make only the first line of each paragraph bold and red.

## Challenge: Fancy First Lines

ðŸ‘‰ Make the **first line** of each diary entry bold and a different color, like a dramatic opening line of a cat diary.
