# Inline-Block Challenge

Oh no! The cats are all in a vertical line, and they can't see each other! Help them stand side by side so they can have a friendly chat.

Make sure to keep them at a friendly distance of 16 pixels apart!

## Hints

- The `display: inline-block;` CSS rule makes the element generate a block box that's flowed with surrounding content as if it were a single inline box.
