# Help the Cat Escape the Water

Oh no! The cat is too close to the water and cats hate water! ðŸ™€ Help the cat move away from the water using the `margin` property.

## Hints

- Use `margin-top`, `margin-right`, `margin-bottom`, or `margin-left` to move the cat away from the water.
- Remember, margins create space outside of an element's border.

## Goal

Move the cat to the bottom of the land, far away from the water above!
