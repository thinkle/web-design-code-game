# Challenge: Create Space Between Kittens

We have two kittens sitting in two separate boxes, but they're too close to each other! 🐱🐱

Your task is to create some space between the two boxes using the `margin` property.

Margin defines the amount of space *between* two elements.

For example:

```css
selector {
  margin: 32px;
}
```
