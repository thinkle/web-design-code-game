# Our Kitten Needs Space
  
Oh no! Kitten is feeling crowded! Move the kitten away from the edge of the box
so she can stretch her paws.

## Box Model Basics

Remember, in the box model, you can put space between the edge of 
an element and its contents by using the `padding` property.

For example:

```css
selector {    
  padding: 8px; /* Space between border and content*/
}
```
