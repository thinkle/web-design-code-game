# Centering the Cat and the Box

In this challenge, you'll need to center the cat inside a box, and then center that box inside the room.

- Center the cat both vertically and horizontally inside the box.
- Next, center the box both vertically and horizontally inside the room.

Ensure that both the cat and the box are perfectly centered. Good luck! To make this extra tricky, you *must* use the box model alone to achieve the centering!
