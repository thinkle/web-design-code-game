# left, right, top, bottom

Every box-model property we've studied (margin, padding, border)
can be specified for only one side at a time, which allows us
to make an item have an item on the left, the right, the top,
or the bottom.

Use a combination of left, right, top and bottom properties to
put the kitten 1/3 of the way across the room, standing on a 
line, just like in the example below.
