# Our Kitten Needs Space
  
Oh no! Kitten is feeling crowded! Move the kitten away from the edge of the box
so she can stretch her paws.

## Box Model Basics

Remember, in the box model, the *size* of the box is determined by
`width` and `height` elements. The *walls* of the box are determined
by the `border` elements. And the space between the *contents* of the
box and the "walls" are determined by *padding*.

```css
selector {
  margin: 16px; /*Put space between elements */
  border: 10px solid black; /* Define border */
  padding: 8px; /* Space between border and content*/
}
```
